# Compton is an X11 Compositor, which has a range of uses but mainly we want
# it for the transparency and fading visuals effects.
sudo apt-get install -y compton

# feh is an image viewer and command-line based wallpaper changer for X11.
sudo apt-get install -y feh

# lxappearance is a GUI app that allows you to change the GTK themes and fonts
# at will, it's quite easy to use. You can configure this manually once the
# install is done, though my GTK configs are included.
sudo apt-get install -y lxappearance

# Installs the Arc GTK themes, which are used in my configs.

# Thunar is a GUI file browser. It's a little less nasty to use with i3 than
# nemo, which is the Mint default, as it doesn't open a desktop over your 
# X11 session. You can configure nemo not to do this, however this is a little
# simpler.
sudo apt-get install -y thunar
